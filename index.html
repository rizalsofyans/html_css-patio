				Amongst the office blocks between stylish Shoreditch and the
				bustle of the city find our lush spot of paradise perched at the
				edge of Finsbury Square's popular bowls green. It's the end of
				our official first day of trading and while it's still a week
				away until we have our first street food chefs in occupation,
				we've had a ball of a day sering up coffees, ice creams and soft
				drinks to our new (and hopefully returning) customers.

				"I'd like to be a part of something with a bit of soul. I really
				want to know about the pople I'm serving, what makes them tick."
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				We will be open this week Monday to Friday from 8am to 6pm so
				pop in to say hello and to enjoy an expert barista coffee or
				real fruit ice lolly on Finsbury Square's Patio
